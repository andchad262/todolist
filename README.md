# To-Do List

This is a simple To-Do List application built on CSS and Javascript along with the aid of Font Awesome 5 and jQuery 3.3.1. The initial list is a make believe list for practicing format in order to gain more experience in developing an application. Any user can add their own To-Dos or delete an item from the list. Included are sample images of the application in original state, hovering over to delete, inputing new to-do, and the new to-do added to the list.
