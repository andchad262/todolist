# To-Do List

This is a simple To-Do List application built on CSS and Javascript. The initial list is a make believe list for practicing format in order to gain more experience in developing an application. Any user can add their own To-Dos or delete an item from the list. Included is a sample photo of the working application. Seems simple but a little more complex than it looks.
